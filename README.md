# pturk_server
this is the pturk server for api endpoints

this sever is build on express and with node js and the run time environment
it is still under development as for now

the aim was to be able to have a different server where I can easily modify the APIs endpoint and modify the response data
according to the growth of the project, more specifically when I want to build a mobile application.

#It is public

give it a star and follow me,

#THANK YOU
